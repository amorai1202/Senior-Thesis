CMU IRB Approval Code: STUDY2018_00000299



This survey is part of a research study conducted by Kevin Jarbo at Carnegie Mellon University and is funded by a university research fund.



Summary This research study will focus on how our individual perceptions and experiences of society and social phenomenon may lead to differences in how we perform tasks, solve problems, and make decisions. This study also examines our those perceptions and experiences influence attitudes, beliefs, and choices about how to interact in academic, social, and societal settings.



Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand how people’s perceptions of society influence their decisions and behavior.



Procedures In this completely online study, you will be asked to read vignettes or informative text and respond to survey items about your thoughts, opinions, feelings, and ratings of agreement or disagreement with statements about the vignettes and text that you read. You will also be asked to complete a task where you have to decide whether two arrangements of 3D blocks match. After the task, you will be asked to respond to items about your approach to doing the task, some general questions about your attitudes, behaviors, and choices in academic and social settings, as well as for demographic information. At the end of the study, you will be asked to read a debriefing form that will provide some additional information about the task and survey items that you completed.



Participant Requirements Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older.



Risks The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. The online survey platform used in this study automatically records IP addresses. To maintain your confidentiality, all IP addresses will be completely removed from data prior to data analysis.



Benefits There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study, but the knowledge learned from this study may provide a better understanding about how people's perceptions of, and experiences in, the world influence motivation, problem-solving, decision-making, as well as behavior in social interactions and society in general.



Compensation & Costs

There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.



Monetary Compensation for Paid Participants on Prolific or Connect. You will receive $4.00 that will be paid upon verification of your completed task and survey responses.



Future Use of Information In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies. We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you. Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.



Confidentiality By participating in this research, you understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon may be required to disclose your consent form, data and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. Your confidentiality will be maintained in the following manner: The researchers will take the following steps to protect participants’ identities: (1) Each participant will be assigned a unique number that differs from your ID on SONA, CloudResearch Connect, Prolific, or Amazon Mechanical Turk; (2) The researchers will record any data collected during the study by number, not by name or ID mentioned in point (1); (3) Any data files will be stored in a secured location accessed only by authorized researchers. (4) IP addresses will be deleted before any data is analyzed. Note that it is possible that your data record could be identified by demographic data alone even from a de-identified data file.
